# Python_Boot_Camp
This repository contains the notes and code used in the Python Boot Camp run by graduate students in the UC Davis Agricultural and Resource Economics department. 

Notes are prepared by the students who are giving lectures each week, but they are typically derived from Quantitative Economics with Python by Thomas J. Sargent and John Stachurski. Note that any material derived from that work is the copyright of those authors, used with attribution. https://python.quantecon.org/index_postgrad.html
